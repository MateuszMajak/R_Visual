Data
 The dataset consists of all data on the Formula 1 races, drivers, constructors, qualifying, circuits, lap times, pit stops, championships from 1950 till the latest 2020 season.

Methodology
 We aim to produce a project that will be in the form of an R markdown report that uses the R visualization functions to answer the following questions amongst others: 


- Question A: How has the competition and level of F1 changed over the years?
- Question B: Is F1 currently being won in qualifying?
- Question C: Do the differences between the cars decrease over the years?
- Question D: Which F1 circuits provide a more even fight?

To summarise all of this we will create various interactive dashboards that allow the user to view a comparison of the results of drivers and teams across seasons, analytical dashboards that show descriptive statistics of drivers comparison having an option to choose the drivers and see their statistics, 
and graphs. The dashboard will use ggplot2 and HTML widgets (including plotly plots optionally) in R and will have theme edits to produce color lineplot with Year and Team filter option. We will also use maps in ggplot2 to show a map plot of number of championships and wins of drivers across the world.





















Introduction to ggplot2 (functions: ggplot(), aes(), geom_point(), ggsave())
Theme editing (functions: themes(), guide_legend(), guides(), labs(), packages: extrafont, ggthemes)
Labels on the graph (functions: geom_text(), geom_label(), geom_text_repel(), geom_label_repel()
Scale editing: (family of scale_* functions)
Barplot and pie plot (functions: geom_bar() and geom_arcpie())
Linear plot (functions: geom_line(), geom_vline(), geom_hline(), geom_rect())
Multiple graphs in ggplot2 (multiplot(), gridarrange(), viewport())
Estimating trends with ggplot2 (geom_smooth())
Visualising distributions: (functions: geom_histogram(), geom_density(), geom_boxplot(), geom_violin())
Maps in ggplot2 (functions: geom_sf)
Stat functions (stat_ family function)
Interactive visualisation in ggplot2 (packages: ggiraph ), htmlwidgets in R
